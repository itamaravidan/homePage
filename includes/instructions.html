                Welcome to Wordle: Car Safety Edition! Here's how you play:
            <ol>
                <li>Guess the Wordle in six tries.</li>
                <li>Each guess must be a valid five-letter word related to car safety. Hit the enter button to submit.
                </li>
                <li>After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.
                </li>
                <li>Green - The letter is in the word and in the correct spot.</li>
                <li>Yellow - The letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.</li>
                <li>Gray - The letter is not in the word in any spot.</li>
                <li>Use the clues to guess the word within six attempts.</li>
